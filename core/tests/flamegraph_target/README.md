# zkSync flamegraph target

This binary is a playground for analyzing the performance of the zkSync components, using tools such as [perf] and
[cargo-flamegraph].

While analyzing the performance of the application overall may be useful, it doesn't really help when you want to
analyze one particular component when it takes ~100% of the runtime, in order to see weak points clearly.

## Design notes

Since the goal is to avoid _everything_ that is not related to the analysis of the particular component, try to avoid
"hidden" runtime logic such as async runtimes (e.g. `tokio::main`) or logging (e.g. `vlog`) in this crate. If the code
you are going to analyze requires `async` support, explicitly create the runtime for said code only.

Target code should be written in a manner that stresses component in the most possible way. If your code needs
initialization, separate it from the actual stressing logic, so that in the resulting flamegraph they will be easily
distinguishable.

That being said, the code is just a playground. It is expected to be adjusted to what you need, so it is OK to keep the
code simple to parameterize with loops, constants, and whatever else helps you achieve representative performance
charts.
